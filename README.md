# GettingAndCleaningData
This is the final peer-graded assignment for the Getting and Reading Data Course from Coursera.  The project is to take the provided data set https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and perform the following:

"You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."

You can find my assignment in this repo.  There are two submissions:
1) A tidy dataset based on the instructions provided.
2) The CodeBook.md which describes the files, the data, provides a little background on the experiments, and notes the transformations I made to the data to complete the assignment.  
3) run_analysis.R which is the codes to complete the assignment.  The code also includes a brief description of each chunck of code and what it is intended to do.
